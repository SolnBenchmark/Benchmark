# SolnBenchmark
SolnBenchmark provides a means to benchmark localization algorithms for stochastic optical localization nanoscopy (SOLN). 


# Purpose
Benchmark the performance of a localization algorithm in estimation of single isolated emitters from a single data frame. 

# Metric
Root mean square minimum distance (RMSMD) between the estimated emitter locations and the ground truth locations. 

# Benchmarking 
The information-achieving unbiased Gaussian estimator that
