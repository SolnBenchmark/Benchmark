# 2DAiry_MEMF_HTR: 2D Airy PSF Multiple Emitter Multiple Frame High Temporal Resolution 

## Purpose
Evaluate and benchmark performance of localization algorithms in localization of multiple emitters from a data movie of multiple frames with high temporal resolution (1 second). 

## Method
### Three data movies 

Three data movies with different distances between adjacent emitters are synthesized and saved as tiff files with 16 bits in depth, each of which is stored in a zip file:

**2DAiry_MEMF_HTR_eD40nm_movie.zip  (For purpose of demonstration, .png images of the 10th frames are shown here.)**

The filenames in submission shall be in the format:

## Parameters
The three data movies are synthesized by using the following parameters. 

### Emitter 

**Emitter distribution**

Emitters are located on a helix with different adjacent-emitter distance in three data movies.

|Data movie filename |Emitter distance| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|2DAiry_MEMF_HTR_eD40nm_movie.zip |40|nm|
|2DAiry_MEMF_HTR_eD30nm_movie.zip |30|nm|
|2DAiry_MEMF_HTR_eD20nm_movie.zip |20|nm|

**Number of emitters and emitter intensity (mean number of emitted photons)**

|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Number of emitters |M=500|  |
|Emitter intensity |I=300000|photons/sec/emitter|
|Analog digital unit |ADU=1|photons/unit|

**Emitter activation**

Each emitter is independently activated by following a Markov chain [2]. The matrix of state transition probabilities is 

| |0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|0 |r00=0.9188 |r01=0.5 |r02=0.7 |r03=0.8 |r04=1.0 |
|1 |r10=1-r00 |0   |0   |0   |0 |
|2 |0   |r21=1-r01 |0   |0   |0 |
|3 |0   |0   |r32=1-r02 |0   |0 |
|4 |0   |0   |0   |r43=1-r03 |0 |

rji indicates the transition probability from state i to j.  

**Stationary probability**

Correspondingly, the stationary probability of state i, i.e. the probability that up to the current frame, an emitter has been activated in i consecutive frames, is given below. The probability of deactivation is the probability that an emitter is not activated in a frame and the probability of activation is the probability that an emitter is activated in a frame. 

|Probability |Variable and value|
|:-----|:-----|
|Probability of state 0 |P0=0.8800|
|Probability of state 1 |P1=0.0714|
|Probability of state 2 |P2=0.0357|
|Probability of state 3 |P3=0.0107|
|Probability of state 4 |P4=0.0022|
|Probability of deactivation |P0=0.8800|
|Probability of activation |Pa=1-P0=0.1200|

### Data movie 
|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Field of view |[0,Lx] x [0,Ly] |nm| 
|Field of view size |Lx=4096, Ly=4096|nm|
|Pixel size |Dx=128, Dy=128|nm|
|Frame size |Kx=32, Ky=32|pixels|
|Frame time |Dt=0.01|sec|
|Movie length |N=100|frames |
|Correspondingly | |
|Frame rate|1/Dt=100|frames/sec|
|Photon count |Dt\*I=3000|photons/frame/emitter|
|Temporal resolution |TR=N\*Dt=1 |sec|
|Average number of activations per emitter |Nape=Pa\*N=12|frames/emitter|
|Average number of activated emitters per frame |Naae=Pa\*M=60|emitters/frame|

The corresponding 2D coordinate in a data frame is shown below. Note y axis points down.

### Optical system
|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit | |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Numerical aperture |na=1.43| | |
|Fluorescence wavelength |lambda=665|nm|Dye Alexa 647 |
|Correspondingly| | | |
|Standard deviation |sigma=97.98 |nm| |
|Full-width half-maximum |FWHM=230.72 |nm| |

PSF is 2D Airy and its standard deviation is estimated by sigma=1.3238/a where a=2\*pi\*na/lambda [1]. 

### Noise 
|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Mean of Poisson noise |b=5|photons/sec/nm<sup>2</sup>|
|Variance of Gaussian noise |G=3|photons/sec/nm<sup>2</sup>| 
|Mean of Gaussian noise |mu=5|photons/sec/nm<sup>2</sup>|

**Corresponding signal to noise ratios and camera offset**

|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Signal to Poisson noise ratio |rp=60000|nm<sup>2</sup>/emitter|
|                             |SPNR=-4.54|dB|
|Signal to Gaussian noise ratio |rg=100000|nm<sup>2</sup>/emitter|
|                             |SGNR=-2.32|dB|
|Total signal to noise ratio |r=37500|nm<sup>2</sup>/emitter|
|                           |SNR=-6.58|dB|
|Effective camera offset |Coff=819.2 |photons/pixel|

The mean of Gaussian noise mu includes the effect of camera offset. When mu is solely contributed by the camera offset, i.e. the Gaussian noise has a zero mean, the effective camera offset is Coff=Dt\*Dx\*Dy\*mu. 

SPNR, SGNR, and SNR are defined in [4].
